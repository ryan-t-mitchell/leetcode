    "Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of l1 and l2. Since each digit is in the range of 0-9, summing two digits may \"overflow\". For example 5 + 7 = 12. In this case, we set the current digit to 2 and bring over the carry = 1 to the next iteration. carry must be either 0 or 1 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19."
